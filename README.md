# Welcome to Eric's personal page
This page will be updated with a selection of my work and projects

## Python Projects
### [landchinascraper](https://github.com/liptao/landchinascraper) - webscraper package (requests, BeautifulSoup4, selenium, and pandas)
Created a Python package to search, scrape and parse HTML from http://www.landchina.com, a website containing records of public land transactions in China. The scraper outputs an excel file or DataFrame object with transaction observations that is ready for analysis!
